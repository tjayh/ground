<!----------------------------------------# SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)---------------------------------------->
	1.	PLEASE READ AND UNDERSTAND BEFORE DEVELOPING OR DESIGNING
	2.	PLEASE try your code first or do trial and error before consulting, GOOGLE is your friend, my friend
	3.	IF found an HTML codes that seems wrong please use appropriate code for it, again GOOGLE is you friend
	4.	REMOVE UNNECESSARY codes if not used and do NOT COMMENT if it will NEVER ever be used
	5.	REMOVE UNNECESSARY lines instead use only INFORMATIVE comments for BETTER development/design references
	6.	ALWAYS BEAUTIFY if you want to organize the .html, .js codes (jsbeautifier.org) and .css (html.fwpolice.com/css) and .php (phpbeautifier.com), please help those who can't read your codes, FAVORITE/BOOKMARK those links
	7.	ALWAYS use proper code line TABULATION .html, .js, .css  and .php, those beautifier will really help or prepare to find codes in disorganized way
	8.	ALWAYS create LOCAL BACKUP a file/s or folder/s before debugging/editing per day, at least you have the latest backup up before you make changes
	9.	REMOVE ALL UNNECESSARY FILES for easy viewing of files after designing (ex. index.html, about.html, careers.html empty_content.css etc.)
	10. IF error found ALWAYS CHECK IF YOUR SMARTY CODES are correct, and lastly GOOGLE is your friend, my friend
	
<!----------------------------------------# Tips/Errors/Solutions---------------------------------------->
Description: Please read this might save lots of time and effort for coding/designing/typing
Important Codes: 
	- Press ctrl + "F" , a pop up FIND will appear, use it to find some inquires here (ex. find "link"), then press F3 for faster find
	- to collapse all html tags (Ex. <p></p>), press alt + 0
	- NEVER use direct link or url of the website in html and js codes
	- When beautified always CHECK the smarty codes curly braces {, } should have NO space before and after see examples codes here
	- Please see SMARTY.NET for more references
	- ALL themes may have different design and not all codes might not be needed
	- UPDATE facebook share - https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
	- CHECK config.php if CORRECT _BASE_URL_ , _THEME_ 
	- please CHECK/DEBUG the codes first
	- don't duplicate jquery.js, jquery-ie.js, bootstrap.css, bootstrap.js because they are atleast they are always updated if not just change the codes inside, don't rename it.
	- most of the time there will only be main.template.html, inner.template.html and error.template.html
	- always add a commented template name at the top of the html to help others what template does frontend page pulls up
	- the rest of the pages will be inside modules, ex. forms, dynamic display of item name, includes folder or part of CMS page (http://[IP ADDRESS HERE]/[PROJECT NAME]/administrator/pages)
	- to add/edit a customized css code (http://[IP ADDRESS HERE]/[PROJECT NAME]/administrator/settings)
	- add numberOnly or textOnly in the class for strict field input
	- use date-picker on the class for date select field
	- some html has <p> </p> <br> <div> </div> etc. (just check the codes) PLEASE DELETE/EDIT/CHANGE this code as you wish, this codes are just extra SOP #3, #4
	- As much as possible NEVER use # in an anchor html tags, this will redirect to ERROR page MOST of the time, REPLACE it with javascript:; instead (Ex. <a href="#"></a> <==BAD, <a href="javascript:;"></a> <==GOOD)
